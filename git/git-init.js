`GIT INIT`;

// To start using git in a project, you need to initialize it. To do this, you need to navigate to the project folder in your terminal and use the following command:

`git init`;  // initializes git in your project folder

// This will create a .git folder in your project folder that stores all the information and versions of your project. You can confirm it worked by using the following command: 

`ls -a`; // lists all files in your project folder including hidden files. You'll see a .git folder

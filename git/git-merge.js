`GIT MERGE`;
// Merging lets you combine done work on one branch with another. You can merge a branch with the current branch using the following command:

`git merge branch-name`;

// When you merge a branch, you are combining the changes you made in that branch with the current branch. If there is a conflict, you will see a message saying that there is a conflict. You can open the file and resolve the conflict. You can then add the file to the staging area and commit it again.

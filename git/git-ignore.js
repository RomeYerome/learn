`GIT IGNORE`;

// You can create a .gitignore file to tell git which files to ignore. This is useful for files that contain sensitive information like passwords or bloat files like node_modules/. To create a .gitignore file, you can use the following command:

`touch .gitignore`;

// You write the name files and folders (/folder-name) you want to ignore in the .gitignore file. To check the contents of the .gitignore file, use the following command to print the contents in the terminal:

`cat .gitignore`;

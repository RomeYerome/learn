`VISIBILITY IN CSS`;
// There are two ways to hide an element in CSS: `display: none;` and `visibility: hidden;`. The difference between the two is that `display: none;` will remove the element from the flow of the document and `visibility: hidden;` will hide the element but it will still take up space in the document.

`DISPLAY: NONE;`;
// The `display: none;` property will remove the element from the flow of the document. This means that the element will not be visible and will not take up space in the document. It is as if the element does not exist. This is useful when you want to hide an element completely from the document. 

// The other values for display are `block`, `inline`, `inline-block`, `flex`, `grid`, `table`, `table-cell`, `table-row`, `table-column` etc.

`VISIBILITY: HIDDEN;`;
// The `visibility: hidden;` property will hide the element but it will still take up space in the document. This means that the element will not be visible but it will still be there. This is useful when you want to hide an element but still have it take up space in the document.

// The other values for visibility are `visible` and `collapse`. The `collapse` value is used with table elements and will hide the element but still take up space in the table.

`MEASUREMENT_UNITS`;
// There are a number of units of measure in CSS. Some are more suited for some tasks and others are more suited for others. They fit into two broad categories: absolute and relative. 

`ABSOLUTE UNITS`;
// Absolute units are fixed and do not change with size of screen or viewport or anything else. They are not recommended for responsive design and should be used intentionally. The most common absolute unit is the pixel (px).

`RELATIVE UNITS`;
// Relative units are relative to something else, usually the size of the viewport or the parent element. They are recommended for responsive design. The most common relative units are the percentage (%) and the em.

`EM`;
// The em is a unit of measure that is relative to the font size of the parent element. It is a good unit to use for responsive design because it will scale with the font size of the parent element. However it is tricky to use because it is relative to the font size of the parent element which is relative to the font size of the grandparent...


`REM`;
// The rem is a unit of measure that is relative to the font size of the root element (html). It is a good unit to use for responsive design because it will scale with the font size of the root element. It is easier to use than the em because it is always relative to the same thing.

`VW`;
// The vw is a unit of measure that is relative to the width of the viewport. 1vw is equal to 1% of the width of the viewport. It is a good unit to use for responsive design because it will scale with the width of the viewport.

`VH`;
// The vh is a unit of measure that is relative to the height of the viewport. 1vh is equal to 1% of the height of the viewport. It is a good unit to use for responsive design because it will scale with the height of the viewport.

`%`;
// The percentage is a unit of measure that is relative to the parent element. It is a good unit to use for responsive design because it will scale with the size of the parent element.

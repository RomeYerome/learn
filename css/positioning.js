`POSITIONING`;
// In CSS, positioning is used to place elements on the page in a specific location. There are four types of positioning in CSS: static, relative, absolute, and fixed. Each type of positioning has its own properties and uses.

// The css properties top, right, bottom, and left are used with the position property to position an element on the page. These properties are used to specify the position of an element relative to its containing element.


`STATIC POSITIONING`;
// Static positioning is the default positioning in CSS. When an element is statically positioned, it is positioned according to the normal flow of the document. This means that the element will appear in the order it is written in the HTML file. Static positioning is not affected by the top, right, bottom, and left properties.


`RELATIVE POSITIONING`;
// Relative positioning is used to position an element relative to its normal position. When an element is relatively positioned, it is positioned according to the normal flow of the document, but can be moved from its normal position using the top, right, bottom, and left properties. The element will still take up the same space as it would if it were statically positioned.


`ABSOLUTE POSITIONING`;
// Absolute positioning is used to position an element relative to its nearest 'relative positioned' containing element or the document itself. When an element is absolutely positioned, it is removed from the normal flow of the document, and if none of it's parents or grand parents have a relative positioning, it moves to the top left corner of the document as it is now relative to the document itself.

// The top, right, bottom, and left properties are used to position the element. The top property specifies the distance from the top edge of the containing element, the right property specifies the distance from the right edge of the containing element, the bottom property specifies the distance from the bottom edge of the containing element, and the left property specifies the distance from the left edge of the containing element.

`NOTE`; // It ignores padding of the parent element, and is positioned relative to the parent element's border.


`FIXED POSITIONING`;
// Fixed positioning is used to position an element relative to the viewport, which means that it will stay in the same position even when the page is scrolled. When an element is fixed positioned, it is removed from the normal flow of the document, and is positioned relative to the viewport.


`STICKY POSITIONING`;
// Sticky positioning is a hybrid of relative and fixed positioning. When an element is sticky positioned, it is treated as relatively positioned (i.e it stays where it is in the document flow) until the page is scrolled to the specified tblr position, at which point it is treated as fixed positioned. This is useful for creating elements that stick to the top of the page when the user scrolls down.




`TBLR PROPERTIES`;
// The top, right, bottom, and left properties are used to position an element on the page. The top property specifies the distance from the top edge of the containing element, the right property specifies the distance from the right edge of the containing element, the bottom property specifies the distance from the bottom edge of the containing element, and the left property specifies the distance from the left edge of the containing element.

// These properties only work on positioned elements (i.e. elements with a position value other than static). If an element is not positioned, the top, right, bottom, and left properties will have no effect.










`Z-INDEX`;
// The z-index property specifies the stack order of an element. An element with a higher z-index value will be displayed on top of an element with a lower z-index value. The z-index property can have the following values: auto, a number, or inherit. The default value is auto.

// The z-index property only works on positioned elements (i.e. elements with a position value other than static). If an element is not positioned, the z-index property will have no effect.




`NOTE`;     // Positioning is not good for responsive design, as it is not flexible. It is better to use flexbox or grid layout for creating responsive layouts. Positioning is best used for creating specific layouts or effects that cannot be achieved with flexbox or grid layout.




`OVERFLOW`;
// The overflow property specifies what should happen if content overflows an element's box. The overflow property can have the following values:

// visible: The overflow is not clipped. It renders outside the element's box.
// hidden: The overflow is clipped, and the rest of the content will be invisible.
// scroll: The overflow is clipped, and a scrollbar is added to see the rest of the content.
// auto: Similar to scroll, but it adds a scrollbar only when necessary.










`FLOAT`;
// Floating in css is used to align block-level elements to the left or right of the page. It is used to create a floating effect for elements. You need to add a width to the element that you want to float for it to work

// Floating is an old technique and is not used in modern web development. It is replaced by flexbox and grid layout. It is not responsive and does not work well on mobile devices.


`CLEARING FLOATS`;
// One of the issues you have to deal with when using float is clearing the float. When you float an element, it is removed from the normal flow of the document. This can cause the parent element to collapse and not take up the space of the floated element. To fix this, you need to clear the float by adding a clearfix to the parent element. You do this by adding the following CSS to the parent element:
`
.clearfix::after {
    content: "";
    clear: both;
    display: table;
}
`;
// This will clear the float and make the parent element take up the space of the floated element.

`Another method`;
// Adding overflow:auto; to the parent element will also help with clearing float, but you need to be careful with your margins and paddings by using borderbox or else you'll have scroll bars
`.clearfix {
    overflow:auto;
}`




    `OVERLAPPING ELEMENTS CAUSED BY FLOAT`;

// Another issue with floating elements is that it can cause elements to overlap. This can happen when you float an element and it overlaps with another element. To fix this, you need to add a margin to the element that is being overlapped. You can do this by adding the following CSS to the element:

`
.element {
    margin-top: 20px;
}
`;

// This will add a margin to the top of the element and prevent it from overlapping with other elements.

// In conclusion, floating is an old technique that is not used in modern web development. It is not responsive and does not work well on mobile devices. It can cause issues with clearing floats and overlapping elements. It is recommended to use flexbox or grid layout instead of floating for creating layouts in web development.

`NOTE:`;
// When you float two elements side by side, the width of both elements should add up to less than 100% of the parent element. This is because floating elements take up space in the parent element and if the width of the elements adds up to more than 100%, they will overflow the parent element. One will push the other down.

// To help with this it is best you have box-sizing: border-box; on the elements you are floating (or on all elements). This will make the width of the elements include the padding and border, so you can set the width to 50% and they will fit perfectly side by side.

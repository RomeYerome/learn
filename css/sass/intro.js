`SASS`;
// SASS is syntactically awesome style sheets. It is a CSS preprocessor that allows you write efficient and beautiful css using advanced capabilities like variables, nested rules, mixins, functions, and more, all with a fully CSS-compatible syntax.

// SASS is a preprocessor scripting language that will be compiled or interpreted into CSS. SASS is a preprocessor that will help you to write clean and organized CSS in a programming construct. It is a superset of CSS, which means that it contains all the features of CSS and extends it with more.

// SASS must be compiled to CSS. You write sass code in a .scss file and then compile it to a .css file. The compiled CSS file can then be linked to your HTML file.


`Setting up SASS`;
// To use SASS in your project, you need to install it. You can install SASS using npm or yarn. To install SASS using npm, run the following command:

// You'll need to have node installed on your machine to use npm. You can download node from the official website.

`npm install sass`;


// Next, initialize npm if you haven't and add a script to compile your sass files. 

`"scripts" : {
    "sass": "sass --watch [sass folder]:[output folder]"
}`
    // Replace [sass folder] with the path to your sass files and [output folder] with the path to the folder where you want the compiled css files to be saved.

    `"scripts" : {
    "sass": "sass -w scss/:../dist/css/"
}`;



// Now, you can run the following command to compile your sass files:

`npm run sass`;


// This command will compile your sass files to css and save them in the specified output folder. The --watch flag will watch for changes in your sass files and automatically compile them to css when you save the changes.


// Next you'll have to create the scss folder and create a file called style.scss in the scss folder. You can then write your sass code in the style.scss file. Also, you'll need to create the output folder where the compiled css files will be saved.

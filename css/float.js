`FLOAT`;
// Floating in css is used to align block-level elements to the left or right of the page. It is used to create a floating effect for elements. You need to add a width to the element that you want to float for it to work

// Floating is an old technique and is not used in modern web development. It is replaced by flexbox and grid layout. It is not responsive and does not work well on mobile devices.


`CLEARING FLOATS`;
// One of the issues you have to deal with when using float is clearing the float. When you float an element, it is removed from the normal flow of the document. This can cause the parent element to collapse and not take up the space of the floated element. To fix this, you need to clear the float by adding a clearfix to the parent element. You do this by adding the following CSS to the parent element:
`
.clearfix::after {
    content: "";
    clear: both;
    display: table;
}
`;
// This will clear the float and make the parent element take up the space of the floated element.

`Another method`;
// Adding overflow:auto; to the parent element will also help with clearing float, but you need to be careful with your margins and paddings by using borderbox or else you'll have scroll bars
`.clearfix {
    overflow:auto;
}`




`OVERLAPPING ELEMENTS CAUSED BY FLOAT`;

// Another issue with floating elements is that it can cause elements to overlap. This can happen when you float an element and it overlaps with another element. To fix this, you need to add a margin to the element that is being overlapped. You can do this by adding the following CSS to the element:

`
.element {
    margin-top: 20px;
}
`;

// This will add a margin to the top of the element and prevent it from overlapping with other elements.

// In conclusion, floating is an old technique that is not used in modern web development. It is not responsive and does not work well on mobile devices. It can cause issues with clearing floats and overlapping elements. It is recommended to use flexbox or grid layout instead of floating for creating layouts in web development.

`NOTE:`;
// When you float two elements side by side, the width of both elements should add up to less than 100% of the parent element. This is because floating elements take up space in the parent element and if the width of the elements adds up to more than 100%, they will overflow the parent element. One will push the other down.

// To help with this it is best you have box-sizing: border-box; on the elements you are floating (or on all elements). This will make the width of the elements include the padding and border, so you can set the width to 50% and they will fit perfectly side by side.

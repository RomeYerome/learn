`STYLING MENUS AND NAVIGATION BARS`;
// Styling navigation with CSS is a well established practice, wether it is a vertical menu or a horizontal navigation. For a long time, menu items were put in a list, and the list was styled to create a navigation bar. This is still a common practice, but there are other ways to create navigation bars with the advent of flexbox.

`CALC`;
// CSS has a special calc() function for doing basic math. It can be used anywhere a length, frequency, angle, time, percentage, number, or integer is allowed. 

// The calc() function takes a single expression as its parameter. The expression can contain addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/) operators. You can also use parentheses to group sub-expressions.

// Here is an example of using the calc() function to calculate the width of a container based on the number of columns you want to display:

// .container {
//     width: calc(100% / 3);
// }

// In this example, the width of the .container class is calculated as 100% divided by 3. This will result in a container that is one-third of the width of its parent element.

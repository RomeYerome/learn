`WHAT IS A COMPONENT?`;
// Components are the building blocks of React applications. A component is a reusable piece of code that defines how a part of the user interface should look and behave. Components can be simple, like a button or a text input, or complex, like a form or a navigation bar. Components can be composed of other components, allowing you to build complex UIs from simple building blocks.

// There are two main types of components in React: functional components and class components. Functional components are simple functions that return JSX elements, while class components are ES6 classes that extend the React.Component class and have a render method that returns JSX elements.

// Components can have properties (props) and state. Props are read-only data that are passed from a parent component to a child component, while state is mutable data that is managed by the component itself. Props are used to pass data down the component tree, while state is used to manage data that can change over time.

// Components can be used to create reusable UI elements that can be shared across different parts of your application. By breaking down your UI into smaller components, you can create a more modular and maintainable codebase.

// Components can be rendered to the DOM using ReactDOM.render() or ReactDOM.createRoot().render(). When a component is rendered, React creates a virtual DOM representation of the component tree and updates the actual DOM to match the virtual DOM. This process is known as reconciliation.

// React components can either have a jsx extension or a js extension. The jsx extension is used to indicate that the file contains JSX code, while the js extension is used for regular JavaScript files that may contain JSX code.

// Components can be created using the React.createElement() method or JSX syntax. JSX syntax is more commonly used because it is more concise and easier to read than the React.createElement() method.

// An example of a simple functional component in React is shown below:

`

import React from 'react';

function Header() {
    return <header>
        <div className="container">
            <h2>Header Title</h2>
        </header>;
}

export default Hello;

`EVENTS IN REACT`;
// Events in React are similar to Vanilla JS. They are actions that can be detected by React. They can be user actions, browser events, or any other events that can be detected by React.

// React events are written in camelCase syntax. For example, onClick, onMouseOver, etc. They take in a callback function as their value.  The callback function is executed when the event is triggered.

// 2. Node JS is needed because you need NPM (Node Package Manager) to install create-react-app. NPM is a package manager for javascript that allows you to install and manage packages and dependencies for your project.

// 3. Visual Studio Code: You need a code editor to write your React code. Visual Studio Code

// 4. Git: Git is a version control system that allows you to track changes in your codebase. You can download and install Git from the official website https://git-scm.com/

// 5. React Developer Tools: React Developer Tools is a browser extension that allows you to inspect the React component hierarchy in the Chrome and Firefox Developer Tools.

`Create React App`;
// Create React App is a tool that allows you to create a new React project with a single command. It sets up your development environment so that you can start building your React application right away. Create React App is the recommended way to start a new React project.

// To create a new React project using Create React App, run the following command in your terminal:


`npx create-react-app my-app`; // Replace my-app with the name of your project. This doesn't install it globally and you can only use it in the directory you're in.

// OR

`npm init react-app my-app [--use npm]`; // Replace my-app with the name of your project. This installs it globally and you can use it anywhere on your system.

// This will create a new directory called my-app with all the necessary files and folders for a React project. It will also install all the dependencies needed to run the project.

// To start the development server and run your React application, navigate to the project directory and run the following command:


`cd my-app`;
`npm start`;    // This will start the development server and open your React application in your default web browser. You can now start building your React application.

`npm run build`; // This will create an optimized production build of static files of your React application. The build folder will contain all the necessary files to deploy your application to a web server.

`npm test`; // This will run the test runner in interactive watch mode. You can write tests for your React components and run them using this command.

`npm run eject`; // This command will remove the Create React App build dependency from your project and copy all the configuration files and build scripts into your project. Use this command if you need more control over the build configuration of your React application. Be careful, as this is a one-way operation and cannot be undone.





`NOTE`;
// To open the current folder in vscode from your terminal, run the command `code .`
// If it doesn't work, open vs code and press `cmd + shift + p` and search for `shell command` and select `install code command in path`

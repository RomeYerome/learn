`WEBPACK`;
// Webpack is a module bundler that takes in your frontend dev files and their dependencies and generates static assets representing those modules.

// It can take your JavaScript, CSS, and images, and transform them into a format that's optimized for the web. Webpack can also bundle your assets together and generate a dependency graph that maps out how your modules are connected.

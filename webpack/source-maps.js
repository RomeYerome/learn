`SOURCE MAPS WITH DEV TOOLS`;
// Source maps are files that map the generated code back to the original source code. That is they tell you which module, line, and column in the original source code corresponds to a given module, line, and column in the generated code. When you build the final js file, if there is an error in the code, the source map will help you to find the error in the original source code module so you can fix it.

// They are useful for debugging and understanding the generated code. Source maps are generated by the webpack build process and can be used by browser developer tools to map the generated code back to the original source code.

// To enable source maps in webpack, you need to set the devtool option in your webpack configuration file. The devtool option specifies the type of source map to generate. Some common values for the devtool option include:

`eval-source-map`; // This is the fastest option but may not be as accurate as other options.

`source-map`; // This is the slowest option but provides the most accurate source maps.

`cheap-source-map`; // This is a faster option than source-map but may not be as accurate.

`cheap-module-source-map`; // This is a faster option than source-map but may not be as accurate.


// Here is an example of a webpack configuration file with the devtool option set to source-map:

const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
    devtool: 'source-map',
};

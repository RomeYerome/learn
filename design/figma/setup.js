// To start designing in figma, the first thing you want to do is to set up your document. This is where you set the size of your canvas, the grid, and the layout of your design.

`THE FRAME`;
// The frame is the canvas of your design. It is where you will place all your design elements. You start by selecting frame from the toolbar and then you can set the size of your frame. You can use one of the default sizes like desktop, tablet, or mobile or you can set a custom size. You can also set the background color of your frame.

`THE GRID`;
// Once the frame is set up, click on it and you'll see the grid settings on the right. Set the grid to a column grid. Choose the number of columns (12 is the most popular cos it is divisble by 2, 3, 4, and 6). Set the gutter width to 30px horizontally and 30px/60px vertically. You can also set the grid color to make it easier to see. Set the margin (e.g to 140px) to push content away from the edges of the frame.

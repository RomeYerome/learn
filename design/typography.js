// Typography is the art of arranging text to make it legible, in tune with the message and appealing in a design. 


`Typeface Personality`;
// Each typeface has a personality. Some are fun, playful, casual, business-like etc.  Using the wrong typeface is like wearing the wrong outfit like wearing cargo pants to a business meeting.




`Typeface Categories`;
// Typefaces are grouped into 4 broad groups

`Sans Serif`; // Serif is french for the slight projections ('tails') at the end of texts. Sans serif are typefaces that don't have them (sans is without). It is what you'll use for most of your projects. They are good for both heading and body text and can range from playful to casual to business-like



`Serif`; // Serif typefaces have tails. 
// There are 3 distinctive styles of Serif Fonts: 

// Old Style: (Most books were written in this) e.g Garamond. It has a very classy personality and is typically used on websites for upscale restaurants, lawfirms, classical music. They are characterized by slanty tails

// Modern: They are characterized by straight horizontal tails and dramatic contrast between thick and thin lines (think of the vogue logo). They are mostly suited to headlines and big text.

// Slab: They are boxy and are suitable for anything that feels mechanical or strong. They are suited for headlines


`Display or Decorative`;
// They have the most personality but that's not necessarily a good thing. They are very playful so your project has to need that for you to delve into display fonts. They are only for headlines

`Script`;
// Script typefaces are based on handwriting. Like display, you want to be sure it is right for your project audience, e.g a daycare



`PROTIP: Most fontfaces will have descriptions that will hint at the personality of the text and also tell you if it is good for paragraph texts or headers or both`;


// When designing for a particular audience, say a daycare website, a good start is to google daycare websites, posters and magazines to get a feel for the right fonts for that audience. This research will guide you in choosing a good typeface for your project








`SETTING TYPE`;

`Letter Spacing`; 
// You can change the look and feel of a title text by increasing or decreasing letter spacing. Airing out a text creates a nice important look and it's great for thin / regular (light) texts. This effect only really looks good with uppercase

// If the text you're using is bold and heavy, you may want to decrease the letter spacing to reduce the bulk of it. This is not restricted to uppercase font


`Line Height`;
// Generally increasing the line height of paragraph text makes it look better easier to read. It goes back to the concept of airing out lighter text. You don't always have to, as the default spacing for some fonts is already great. A typical value is about 1.5 to 1.6

// With heavy texts the reverse is the case. If you have a heavy multi-line title text, you want to reduce it's profile by reducing the line height. A coomon value is about 1.2 to 1.3


`Font-Weight`;
// Typefaces come in different weights - thin, light, regular, bold, heavy, black. Some typefaces will have only 2 weights while others have up to 9. You want to pick a font-face that has 4 or more weights so you have flexibility while designing.

// For example, a regular font will look bolder the bigger it gets. If you want it to look the same weight as a smaller version next to it, you make have to make the smaller one bold or the bigger one light to compensate for this optical illusion


'Contrast';
// With Typography, you want to create contrast, especially between headers and body text. You can do this by using different typefaces, different weights, different sizes, different colors etc.



`USE TWO TYPE FACES MAX`;
// PROTIP: When designing a website, you want to use a maximum of 2 typefaces. One for the headers and one for the body text. You can use different weights of the same typeface to create contrast

`PICKING GOOD COLORS`;
// Picking great colors for your project can be a hassle. Here are some tips to help you pick the right colors for your project

`1. Pick colors from nature`; // We all agree that nature is great art, so pick colors from a beautiful real life picture. To do this, blur the image so you get an average color in a region you're picking from

`2. Pick colors from a website you like`; // If you like a website, you can pick colors from it. You can use a color picker tool to get the hex codes of the colors.

`3. Use a color palette generator`; // There are a lot of color palette generators online. You can use them to generate color palettes for your project.

`4. Use a color wheel`; // A color wheel is a great tool for picking colors. You can use it to pick colors that are complementary, analogous, triadic etc.



`Color Matching`;
// Colors typically match when they have the same hue, saturation or brightness. That's how colors exist in nature. You can use this to your advantage when picking colors for your project.

// NOTE: Avoid fully saturated colors (unless your project calls for it). They can be hard on the eyes. There's a reason they don't exist in nature





`Color Pallete`;
// Using any of the color picking methods above, you can create a color palette for your project. A color palette is a set of colors that work well together. You can use a color palette to create a harmonious color scheme for your project.

// A good color palette typically has a primary color, secondary color, and an accent color. The primary color is the main color of your project, the secondary color is a supporting color, and the accent color is used to highlight important elements on the page.

// You can also use different shades of the same color in your color palette. This creates a monochromatic color scheme, which is a subtle and harmonious color scheme.

// Your color palette should have contrasting colors (darks and lights) and also include neutral colors, such as black, white, and gray. These colors can be used to create a sense of balance and harmony in your design.

// A good color pallete should have 3 to 5 colors. Too many colors can make your design look cluttered and unprofessional.




`Fine Tuning Colors`;
// After picking your colors, you may need to fine-tune them to make sure they work well together. You can do this by adjusting the hue, saturation, and brightness of the colors.



`Tint, Shade, Tone`;
// Tint, shade, and tone are three terms used to describe the brightness of a color. Tint is a color with white added to it, shade is a color with black added to it, and tone is a color with gray added to it. You can use tints, shades, and tones to create a more interesting and dynamic color palette.






`Color Theory`;
// Color theory is a set of principles used to create harmonious color combinations. These principles are used in art, design, and other creative fields. Color theory is based on the color wheel, which is a circular diagram that shows the relationships between colors.

`Primary colors`; // The primary colors are red, blue, and yellow. These colors are the building blocks of all other colors. They can not be created by mixing other colors.

`Secondary colors`; // The secondary colors are orange, green, and purple. These colors are created by mixing the primary colors.

`Tertiary colors`; // The tertiary colors are created by mixing a primary color with a secondary color. There are six tertiary colors: red-orange, yellow-orange, yellow-green, blue-green, blue-violet, and red-violet.

`Complementary colors`; // Complementary colors are colors that are opposite each other on the color wheel. They create a strong contrast when used together.

`Analogous colors`; // Analogous colors are colors that are next to each other on the color wheel. They create a harmonious color scheme when used together.

`Triadic colors`; // Triadic colors are three colors that are evenly spaced around the color wheel. They create a vibrant color scheme when used together.

`Monochromatic colors`; // Monochromatic colors are different shades of the same color. They create a subtle and harmonious color scheme.

`Warm colors`; // Warm colors are colors that are associated with warmth, such as red, orange, and yellow. They create a sense of energy and excitement.

`Cool colors`; // Cool colors are colors that are associated with coolness, such as blue, green, and purple. They create a sense of calm and relaxation.

`Neutral colors`; // Neutral colors are colors that are not on the color wheel, such as black, white, and gray. They create a sense of balance and harmony.

`Color psychology`; // Color psychology is the study of how colors affect human behavior and emotions. Different colors can evoke different emotions and feelings in people. For example, red is associated with passion and energy, while blue is associated with calm and tranquility.

`Color meanings`; // Different colors have different meanings in different cultures. For example, white is associated with purity and innocence in Western cultures, while it is associated with death and mourning in Eastern cultures.

`LAYOUT`;
// The layout of a webpage is essential to good design. It is the first thing that a user sees when they visit a website. The layout of a webpage is the way that the content is arranged on the page. A badly laid out page looks disorganized and unprofessional.


`Alignment`;
// Aligning a composition makes it look beautiful. As humans we crave order and alignment is a way to achieve that. Bad designers drop elements randomly on a page and hope for the best. 

// There are 6 options for aligning elements. Left, right, center, top, bottom, and middle.




`Grids`;
// A grid is the best way to align elements on a page. It is a series of intersecting horizontal and vertical lines that help to organize the elements on a page. Grids are used in print design, web design, and other types of design. They help to create a sense of order and structure on a page.

`Types of grids - the 12 column grid`;
// The most popular grid is the 12 column grid. It is a flexible grid that can be used to create a variety of layouts. The 12 column grid is divided into 12 equal columns. Each column is 1/12th of the width of the page. The columns are separated by gutters, which are the spaces between the columns.

// The vertical gutters are usually the same width as the horizontal gutters or double it. The gutters help to create a sense of space between the columns. They also help to create a sense of order and structure on the page. Most times the gutter is 30px horizontally and 30px/60px vertically.

`Going off grid`;
// Sometimes you may want to break the grid to create a more dynamic layout. This can be done by using elements that span multiple columns or rows. This can create a more interesting and dynamic layout. The key element here is that you are intentionally choosing to break the grid not just randomly dropping pieces about. 

// A good example is the centre alignment of a web page. The centre alignment is not on the grid but it is a good way to create a focal point on a page.

`Golden ratio`;
// The golden ratio is a mathematical ratio that is found in nature. It is a ratio of 1:1.618. The golden ratio is often used in design to create a sense of balance and harmony. It is used to create a sense of order and structure on a page. The golden ratio is used in typography, layout, and other aspects of design.





`Visual Heirarchy`;
// Visual hierarchy is the arrangement of elements in a design in order of importance. More important elements are bigger, bolder, have more contrast... just generally more imposing. The principle here is that we can not focus on multiple things at once. So we need to guide the user's eye to the most important elements first.

// Using a hero section for example, You want to answer 3 questions with visual heirarchy. 1. What is this website about? 2. What do I get out of it? 3. How do I get it? 

// The most important element is the first question. So you make it the biggest, boldest, and most contrasted. The other questions are less important so they are smaller, less contrasted, and less bold.




`Optical Illusions`;
// Often two elements on a page will have the same width or size e.g a circle and a square, but the circle will look smaller. It is important that you compensate for how they look and make the circle slightly bigger instead of sticking with exact measurements.

// Generally, heavier objects will look bigger and you need to compensate for this illusion.

// Another common example is when designers want to put text in a box, they find the vertical middle and place the text. The problem is texts are heavy and they sink. i.e they look like they're lower than the middle. You have to compensate for this by lifting them slightly above the middle.

// Basically, if you feel like something looks bigger, lower etc. compensate. Don't stick to actual measurements





`Proximity`;
// The basic idea of proximity is that, things that are related should be close together (grouped), and unrelated things should be spaced out.

// For example, nav links are related and should be together, Title text and description text in the hero section are related and should be grouped. The CTA buttons in the hero section should be a little further from the text because they are not as related. 

// Proximity implies relation

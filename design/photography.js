`Text on images`;
// Using images as backdrops for text usually presents one problem. The text is hard to read. To solve this problem, you can do the following:

// 1. Use a semi-transparent overlay; // A semi-transparent overlay can help to make the text more readable. .

// 2. Apply a drop shadow to the text; // A drop shadow can help to make the text more readable. 

// 3. Use a contrasting color on the text

// 4. Use a text box behind the text; 

// 5. Use a gradient; // You can use a gradient to make the text more readable. 

// 6. Blur the image.

`IMPROVING INTEREST IN IMAGES`;

`Cropping Techniques`;
// Cropping is the process of removing parts of an image to create a focus on the subject. There are several techniques for cropping an image:


// 2. Soft cropping; // Soft cropping is a technique fades the edge of an image into white or black to give a sense of infinity. Think of clouds in a sky, fading the edge to white will give a sense of continuum. It's also great for adding text to images.

// 3. Extreme crop; // Extreme cropping is a technique that removes most of the image to create a sense of mystery. It can create a sense of intrigue and make the viewer want to know more. It leaves just enough to give a hint of what the image is about. like the tail of a guitar, or the edge of a face, or zooming all the way in to a lions face.

// 4. Diagonal crop; // Diagonal cropping is a technique that crops an image along a diagonal line. This creates a sense of movement and energy in the image. It can make the image more dynamic and interesting. It's like peaking through a peephole or blinds.


`Rule of thirds`;
// The rule of thirds is a compositional rule for landscape pictures that divides an image into 9 equal parts with 2 horizontal lines and 2 vertical lines. The rule of thirds states that the most important elements in an image should be placed along one of the two vertical lines or at the intersections of these lines. This creates a sense of balance and harmony in the image. It is a good way to create a sense of movement and energy in an image.


`Leading lines`;
// Leading lines are lines in a picture that lead the viewer's eye to the subject of the image. Leading lines can be straight or curved. They can be roads, rivers, fences, or anything that leads the eye to the subject. Leading lines are a good way to create a sense of movement and energy in an image.





`Unboxing an image`;
// Photos come in a box. They have edges and it's not enough to just put them with their box in a composition. Most times you want to break the box by masking the subject of the image so you can place it naturally in the composition. This is called unboxing an image. It makes the image look more natural and less staged. It's a good way to create a sense of movement and energy in an image.








`PICKING THE RIGHT IMAGE`;
// When picking images for your project, you should consider the following:

// 1. Is the scene real. Is it natural and would it happen in real life? // Avoid staged images. They look fake and unprofessional. Use natural images that look real and authentic.

// 2. Do the emotions seem real? // Most models struggle to convey real emotions. The emotions in the image should be real and authentic. They should help to convey your message and create a sense of emotion. For example, if you are designing a website for a spa, you should use images that have calming emotions.

// 3. Does the set look real? // The clothing the accessories in the image, do they look legit?

// 4. Stay away from things like light bulbs and abstracts. They are mostly overused and boring

`DESIGN TRICKS`;

`Contrast`;
// Contrast is the difference between two elements in a design. It can be used to create a sense of balance and harmony in a design. There are several types of contrast:

// 1. Color contrast; // Color contrast is the difference between two colors. It can be used to create a sense of balance and harmony in a design. For example, you can use a dark color against a light color to create contrast.

// 2. Size contrast; // Size contrast is the difference between two elements in a design. It can be used to create a sense of balance and harmony in a design. For example, you can use a large element against a small element to create contrast.

// 3. Shape contrast; // Shape contrast is the difference between two shapes in a design. It can be used to create a sense of balance and harmony in a design. For example, you can use a square shape against a circle shape to create contrast.

// 4. Texture contrast; // Texture contrast is the difference between two textures in a design. It can be used to create a sense of balance and harmony in a design. For example, you can use a rough texture against a smooth texture to create contrast.

// 5. Weight contrast; // Weight contrast is the difference between two elements in a design. It can be used to create a sense of balance and harmony in a design. For example, you can use a heavy element against a light element to create contrast.




`White space`;
// White space is empty space around an element. It is used to draw attention to important elements in a page or create a sense of movement. Amateur designers tend to fill every space in a design with elements. This makes the design look cluttered and unprofessional.

`The exception to white space is grouping. If elements are related, they should be close together. If they are unrelated, they should be spaced out.`;





`Repitition`;
// Repetition is the use of the same element, or patterns in a design. It improves a design by creating a sense of familiarity and consistency.

// Repitition can be used in many ways: 

// 1. Layout Repitition; // This is where alignment and the grid comes in. Repeating layout patterns improves a design

// 1. Repitition of color; // Using the same color in different elements in a design.

// 2. Repitition of shape/form; // Using the same shape in different elements in a design harmonizes it. If your site has curves, try not to break it with sharp edges. If the pictures on your site are unboxed, try to stick to unboxed images. If you introduce a new shape or burst or doodle, try to use it in more than one place

// 3. Repitition of texture; // Using the same texture in different elements in a design.

// 4. Repitition of layout; // Using the same element placement in different elements in a design. This is where alignment and the grid comes in.

// 5. Repitition of Typography; // Using the same font in different elements in a design.

// 6. Photography Consistency; // Try to stick with the same consistency with photos. If your photos are desaturated, introducing a hyper-saturated picture will stick out like a sore thumb. Or the lighting in the photos should be consistent etc.

// 7. Repitition of spacing; // Using the same spacing in different elements in a design.

// 8. Consistency of icons; // Use similar icons for your site. If two icons have borders, don't put a 3rd one that doesn't have an outline. If you're using hollow icons, stick with hollow icons




`Overlapping`;
// Overlapping is a technique where elements overlap each other in a design. It can be used to create a sense of depth and movement in a design. Overlapping can add visual interest to your design.





`Tension`;
// Tension gives your design a sense of energy and movement. You can introduce tension with angles. Tilting a box to a 30-degree angle can create the illusion that it's about to fall or that it's moving. Slashing a rectangle at an angle creates tension. 

// 1. Moving elements to the edge of the page like they're coming out of the page creates tension.

// 2. Using diagonal lines in a design creates tension.

// 3. Using a diagonal crop in an image creates tension.

// 4. Moving one element off the grid creates tension.

// 5. Tilting an element creates tension


// Tension is the reason why extreme cropping, overlapping etc are interesting





`SECRETS TO LEARNING DESIGN`;

`Copy Good Design`;
// Copying is the best way to learn design. You can copy a design you like and try to recreate it. This will help you to understand the design principles used in the design. You can also copy a design and try to improve it. This will help you to develop your design skills.

// When you want to learn to play a guitar, you don't try to create your own music. You start by playing other people's music. The same goes for design. Start by copying other people's designs. You'll learn a lot from it.

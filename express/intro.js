`WHAT IS EXPRESS?`;
// Express is a minimal and flexible server-side Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. it is used for routing, middleware, and rendering views and is a significant upgrade from the built-in Node.js http server.

// It is the most popular Node.js web application framework, and is the underlying library for a number of other popular Node.js web frameworks. It simplifies the process of creating a server, handling HTTP requests, making it easier to serve static files, handle requests, and manage cookies.

// Express is lightweight, fast, and unopinionated (no predetermined way to use it), and it is a great tool for creating APIs and web servers.

`INSTALLING EXPRESS`;
// Install Node.js if you don't have it, and initialize npm, you can install Express by running the following command in your terminal:

`npm install express`; // OR `npm i express`

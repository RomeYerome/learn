`VARIABLES AND CONSTANTS IN JAVASCRIP`;

// Variables are used to store data that can be used later in the program. They are declared using the var, let or const keyword.
// names of variables/constants can contain letters, numbers, underscores and the $ sign but it can't start with numbers
// they are case sensitive

`VAR & LET`;
// VAR and LET are used to declare variables. They are similar on the global scope but differ in local scope with LET conforming to local / block level scope while var does not. This means that var can be accessed outside it's block while let can't.

// They can be initialized without assigning a value. In this case it's value is undefined. 

var name;   // undefined

`LET`;
// Let is a new ES6 standard and is better than var cos it conforms to block level scope while var can show up outside it's block and cause unplanned issues.


`CONST`;
// CONST is used for declaring constants and once created it's value can't be changed... a pseudo exception are arrays/objects where the values inside can be changed. 

// You also can't create a const and not assign a value as you do with VAR and LET

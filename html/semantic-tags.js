`SEMANTIC TAGS`;
// Semantic means "meaning" or "sense". Semantic tags are tags that clearly define their meaning in a human- and machine-readable way. They are tags that convey the meaning of the text they contain in addition to giving structure and defining layout.

// Semantic tags were created in HTML5 to improve the structure and semantics of web documents. They are more descriptive than the traditional div and span tags. They are also more accessible to people with disabilities, and they help search engines to better understand the content of web pages.



`DIV AND SPAN`;
// The div and span tags are generic containers that do not convey any meaning. They are used to group elements together for styling purposes. They are not semantic tags. The div tag is a block-level element and div simply means "division" - repesenting a portion of your page. The span tag is an inline element and span means "a small portion of text".



`SEMANTIC DIV REPLACEMENTS`;
// The following are some examples of semantic tags that can be used as replacements for the div tag:

`header`;   // A block-level element that represents a group of introductory or navigational aids.
`nav`;      // A block-level element that represents a section of a page that links to other pages or to parts within the page.
`main`;     // A block-level element that represents the main content of the page.
`article`;  // A block-level element that represents an independent piece of content that can stand on its own.
`section`;  // A block-level element that represents a thematic grouping of content.
`aside`;    // A block-level element that represents content that is tangentially related to the content around it.
`footer`;   // A block-level element that represents a group of footer content.




`OTHER SEMANTIC TAGS`;
// The following are some examples of other semantic tags that can be used in HTML:

`search`;   // A block-level element that specifies a search field as its content.
`figure`;   // A block-level element that specifies self-contained content, like illustrations, diagrams, photos, code listings, poems etc. and contains an optional caption
`figcaption`; // A block-level element that represents a caption or legend for the content of a figure element.
`time`;     // An inline element that represents a specific period in time or a range of time.
`mark`;     // An inline element that represents text highlighted for reference or notation purposes.
`progress`; // An inline element that displays an indicator showing the completion progress of a task, typically displayed as a progress bar.
`meter`;    // An inline element that represents a scalar measurement within a known range.
`details`;  // A block-level element that represents additional details that the user can view or hide.
`summary`;  // A block-level element that represents a summary, caption, or legend for the details element.
`address`;  // A block-level element that represents contact information for its nearest article or body element ancestor.




`PRE HTML5 SEMANTIC TAGS`;
// Before HTML5, web developers used div tags to group elements together and style them. This made it difficult for search engines to understand the content of web pages. HTML5 introduced semantic tags to improve the structure and semantics of web documents. The following are some examples of pre-HTML5 semantic tags:

`form`;     // A block-level element that represents a form, which is used to collect user input.
`label`;    // An inline element that represents a label for a form control.
`code`;     // An inline element that represents a fragment of computer code.
`blockquote`; // A block-level element that represents a section that is quoted from another source.
`cite`;     // An inline element that represents the title of a work, such as a book or movie.
`abbr`;     // An inline element that represents an abbreviation or acronym.
`dfn`;      // An inline element that represents the defining instance of a term.
`kbd`;      // An inline element that represents user input, typically keyboard input.
`samp`;     // An inline element that represents sample output from a computer program.
`var`;      // An inline element that represents a variable or placeholder in a mathematical expression or programming context.
